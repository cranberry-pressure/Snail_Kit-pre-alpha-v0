# Letter to the Internet

Dear Internet,

 Peer to peer systems allow users to experience a resilient internet. Snail Project helps users interact with data in a friendly dashboard. The interface is built with the help of [IPFS](http://ipfs.io). The goal is to make it easy for anyone to participate in growing the decentralize web. It may be difficult for the average user to see how IPFS can benefit their lives. Developers around the world have been embracing this technology by implementing IPFS in multiple applications. Users hardly ever know if they are interacting with the technology in most applications. I believe we can have the average consumer directly using this powerful tool to help grow the decentralized web.

The dashboard includes all the normal features of IPFS. With IPFS, it is easy to upload data allowing other nodes to store or access the data. There are two roles users can play within the Snail Project environment. Every node can participate by being a peer or an operator. The operatorâ€™s job is to create a cluster where they control the new data being added. They have full control of the type data being shared in the cluster. Every cluster has a unique address that is shared with peers who want to join. After a peer has joined, the node will be alerted to store new data without the user having to keep track. This interface will make the process easy for users to create and participate in interesting ecosystems full of all types of data. Hopefully we can get more users directly interacting with IPFS.

Snail Project is still in its pre-alpha stage of development. Continued research will be done to see the best methods for users interacting with protocols like IPFS. We can get over a billion users sharing on a decentralized web, we just need to continue to show people the benefits. 

Sincerely,

Jimmy Debe
